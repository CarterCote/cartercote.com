building something is an extension of the mind. it's why a company is called your "brainchild."

but here's the problem: the vast majority of people lack self-awareness on what actually drives them. on average, after about 25 seconds of questioning, the average person cannot explain their goal in life.

it's never concrete—but the average person avoids thinking about it. they stay busy. they chase the next thing. and the stack of goal-setting and executing crumbles if you don't even know what you want.

## if you don't develop purpose, it's hard to have confidence you'll do something significant

a huge reason people don't self-actualize is because they lack self-efficacy.

the spectrum of self-efficacy often correlates to predictors of success. those who lack self-efficacy don't have an appetite for risk and don't pursue their interests. on the other hand, those with too much self-efficacy have the delusion that often drives them to success—or pretty close.

grit and perseverance separate a person with potential from someone who actually finds success. but once they achieve self-efficacy, their next hurdle is a complicated matrix: setting the right goals, building the right habits, and developing a strong sense of self-awareness.

people that don't self-actualize haven't set actionable goals. you have to start in some fashion. a lot of people think success happens overnight, but consistency is the most important skill to make progress—regardless of what you want.

your goals are defined by your "why"—and your "why" determines whether you stick with it.

## the privilege of purpose

people that aren't chained to society have more room for solitude and opportunity to find their core "why."

this is why many entrepreneurs come from wealthy backgrounds—or why wealthy people spend more time pursuing their "passions." they're more privileged to have that chance. they're not restricted to traditional societal constructions: finding a job, making their parents proud, surviving.

they can spend more time thinking critically about their why.

i don't think this excuses anyone from living a purpose-driven life. but there are systemic gaps that enable purpose-driven people to find their success. hard path, easy life—that's how you break herd mentality. but breaking free requires agency, and agency often requires flexibility that not everyone has.

"forge your own path even if you feel delusional."

## work backwards from your dream life

the question isn't "what can i build?" it's "what should i build?"

and to answer that, you need to work backwards. figure out your dream life first. not abstract—concrete. what does your day look like? who are you with? what are you working on? what do you feel?

then align that vision with your core values. break it down into actionable steps. identify your current limitations—financial stability, time freedom, skills—and find ways to overcome them.

money is simply a tool to live. the dream lifestyle isn't about wealth for wealth's sake. it's about designing a life where your daily actions align with your purpose.

## the 5 things people with purpose know

people who have found their "why" know these five things:

1. who they were
2. what they did
3. who they did it for
4. what those people wanted or needed
5. what they got out of it—how they changed as a result

when people ask "what do you do?"—don't answer with your job title. answer with what you do, who you do it for, and what they get out of it.

"i create things that make their lives better."

happier people make it a point to make other people happy. if you make other people happy, life teaches you that you'll be taken care of too.

## finding alignment

the emphasis on discovering your "why" isn't abstract philosophy. it's practical.

understanding why you're pursuing a goal drives long-term consistency and fulfillment. aligning your "why" with your values and desired lifestyle makes it actionable rather than just inspirational.

that alignment creates more opportunity for reaching peak fulfillment and potential in life. otherwise, it may feel like nothing matters.

and that's the real danger—not failure, but emptiness. building something without knowing why you're building it. succeeding by someone else's definition. arriving somewhere and realizing it's not where you wanted to be.

find your why first. then build.
