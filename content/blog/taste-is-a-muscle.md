## taste is a muscle

in consumer, taste is one of the most important traits you can have. unlimited resources, capital, and talent won't save you from not having taste.

some argue that taste can't be learned, but i'd frame it as a muscle rather than a skill.

taste is about what you consume. it means you have a pulse on the algorithm. it means you know what one-liners are gonna go viral. what ideas are gonna be successful based on your grasp of understanding human psychology.

it means you know what will invoke strong emotion, and what will be pleasing to the eye. you know what tells a story, and what makes that story inherently understood.

it means you understand the importance of vivid images, and crafting a user experience—not just interfaces.
