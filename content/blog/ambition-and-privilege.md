there's a false narrative that to be ambitious, you need to be like zuckerberg. drop out of harvard. come from a family that can catch you if you fall. have access to the right networks, the right schools, the right safety net.

people genuinely think they need to follow that playbook to be considered ambitious or to have a shot at building something meaningful. but that narrative is built on a point of privilege that most people don't have—and it's not even the full picture.

i think this perception exists because the noise you hear is generated most by individuals who come from privilege. their successes are more vocal because they care about power and status more than money. the money is trivial to them—it's the status that drives them.

but the more i think about it, the more i realize ambition really comes from one of two places: a pursuit of status, or the necessity of survival.

## privilege builds a different risk profile

when your basic needs are secure, ambition shifts to less tangible rewards—social capital, influence, intellectual stimulation.

this is why privileged individuals often pursue ambitious goals driven by status. they couldn't care less about the money. it's power and status. and that affords them the privilege to take risks that others simply can't.

think about bill gates. his dad was a prominent lawyer. bill went to one of three US high schools that had computers at the time. that's a ridiculous set of cards. the gates family had access to rare resources that significantly increased bill's likelihood of success. privilege compounds.

the same goes for zuckerberg. these origin stories don't align with the average person. yet somehow they became the blueprint for what ambition is supposed to look like—drop out of an elite school, build in your dorm room, take the leap.

their advice on building a company is invaluable. but how they thought about taking the leap isn't valid for everyone else. they had a safety net most people don't. the "drop out and build" narrative is a privilege in itself.

## survival creates a different kind of ambition

on the other side, less privileged individuals pursue ambition out of necessity—survival, family responsibility, upward mobility. this creates a distinctly different emotional and strategic approach.

and there are way more examples of people from tough backgrounds starting massive companies than we typically hear about:

- naval ravikant — poor kid from india
- jan koum — whatsapp founder, grew up in ukraine, was on food stamps
- jack ma — failed his college entrance exam twice, rejected from 30 jobs including KFC
- brian chesky — had $1,000 in the bank when he started airbnb
- jay chaudhry — grew up in a village in india with no electricity, now worth billions from zscaler
- howard schultz — grew up in housing projects in brooklyn
- larry ellison — grew up in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in chicago
- shiv nadar — founded HCL, now worth $36B, came from a small town in india

these stories show ambition as resilience rather than purely opportunity or status-driven. but they're less publicized because these founders often don't care as much about the visibility.

## visibility bias

popular narratives focus disproportionately on highly privileged success stories. this visibility bias skews our perception of what ambition and entrepreneurial risk-taking actually looks like.

the reason we're more exposed to gates and zuckerberg is because they care about power and status. their successes are louder. but that doesn't mean ambition requires privilege—it just means we hear more from those who have it.

## it scales across all levels

this realization scales downwards across every level of inequality. privilege is relative. ambition manifests differently depending on someone's starting point.

a first-generation college student taking on debt to start a company is taking a fundamentally different risk than someone whose parents can bail them out. both are ambitious. both are valid. but the emotional weight and the stakes are completely different.

i think about first-generation indian executives a lot. they went through so much and often did it for their family. ambition rooted in familial responsibility, generational sacrifice, and collective success. that's a different kind of drive than doing it for status or intellectual stimulation.

## the takeaway

ambition isn't binary—privileged vs. non-privileged. it's a spectrum influenced by context.

if you come from privilege, own it. use it. but recognize that your risk profile is different.

if you don't, know that some of the biggest companies in the world were built by people who had nothing. study their journeys, not just the ones that get the most clicks.

the source of your ambition—whether it's status or survival—doesn't make it more or less valid. what matters is that you're building. -->
